## What is Linux
- Linux is a kernel not operating system.
- Kernel is what joins Software and Hardware.
- Linux is developed by programing language called "C".
## History of Linux
- Linux began in 1991 as personal project by Finnish Student Linus Torvalds to create a new free operating system kernel.  
- Richard Stallman announced the GNU project in 1983 and Cofounded the free software   foundation in 1985.
- GNU is a free software replacement to the Unix OS, But it was just software replacement not full OS.
- So GNU + Linux Kernel  will give GNU/Linux OS.

## What is Shell
- Is a way to communicate with the kernel.
- Shell is a command line Interpreter.
- Shell translates commands of the user for the kernel and Backward.
## Types of Shell
- There are over 500 shell types. There are main or fluently used  4 types :-  
            - SH 
            - BASH
            - ZSH
            - Fish
 - There D/F lies on there Typing, Coloring, Energy Level etc...

## What is OS
- OS is the core of Computer.
- It contains:-
        - Kernel 
        - Software
        - Desktop Environment
        - File Extensions 
        - Windows Manager
## Kernel
- We can access the Kernel of Linux But We can't access the kernel of Windows B/c We don't have the kernel of windows but we have the kernel of Linux.
## Desktop Environment
####       Types of Desktop Environment on Linux
1. Mate
2. Gnome
3. KDE Plasma
4. XFCE
### Windows Manager
       i3- Windows-Manager
   - Is a tiling windows manager, completely written from scratch. Â The target           platforms are GNU/Linux and BSD operating systems, our code is Free and         Open Source Software (FOSS) under the BSD license.
## Why Linux
- It doesn't need no high spec computer( If u have low spec u can download low end software) But not in windows.
- **MOST USED**:-  47% of professional developers use Linux-based OS.
              - Linux powers 39.2% of website whose OS is known.
              - Linux powers 85% of smartphones.
              - The Linux market site Worldwide will reach $15.64 Billion by 2027.
              - 96.3% web servers are in Linux.
- **MOST HACKING TOOLS**:- MOST Tools are build for Linux.
- **MOST SECURED**:- But Windows the Builders can access your file or Data.
             - Linux doesn't have any Workers that can access your files or data.(You have Full Control OVER Your System).
## Linux Distributions/Distro
- Distro is Modified Linux Kernel. 
- What You Can Modify:-
             - Linux Kernel
             - Packages(GNU)
             - Package Manager
             - Desktop UI
## Types of Distro
### Debian                            AND Fedora, REDHAT etc...
- Kali Linux                                             
- Ubuntu
- Parrot
### Arch
- Black Arch
- Garuda
## Which is best for hackers?
- Kali Linux
- Parrot OS
- Garuda
- Black Arch
## Kali Linux
- Is Debian based derived Linux distribution designed for  digital forensics and penetration testing.
- It's maintained ad funded by offensive Security.
- Desktop Env: Xfce
- Package Manager: APT
- Shell: Bash
## Parrot OS
- Is a Linux-based operating system designed for security, privacy, and development purposes.
- Desktop Env: Mate
- Package Manager: APT
- Shell: Bash
## Garuda
- Is a Linux distribution based on the arch Linux operating system.
- Desktop Env: KDE plasma

## Do Windows have distros?
- Windows is not open-source so peoples won't is / edit it, so there won't be other kind.
- It just give Updates.
##      So.. How Can we use it?
#### A, Main OS
- This Method is used for low spec PCs.
- It involves Deleting the OS You have already installed and installing Linux.
#### B, Dual Boot
- You can use this Method by dividing Your Disk Partition the use the second partition for Linux OS.  
#### C, Live Boot
- By Using another Disk
- Ex. Flash
#### D, Cloud Terminals
- Using Website Terminal.
- Ex. Webminal.com
#### E. Virtual Machine
- This Machine Can let us use both OS at the same time.
- To use this way you need to enable technology called Virtualization. 
#### F. WSL(Windows Subsystem for Linux)
- ......
#### G. Termux - Android
- For Phones 
- For running some codes and doing simple things!
