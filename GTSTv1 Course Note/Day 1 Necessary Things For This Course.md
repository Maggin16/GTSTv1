## Intro to CS
- CS is a Very wild field in the IT world.
- It's for protecting systems, networks and programs from digital attacks.
- Cyber attacks are sometimes called Hacking.
## What is Hacking?
- Hacking is referred to exploiting system vulnerabilities and compromising security controls to gain unauthorized access to the system.
- The person who do this jobs or things is called HACKER.
- Ethical Hacker: is hacking with ethics(WITHOUT VIOLATING THE LAW) 
## Types of Hackers Based on Ethics
######        There are 3 types of hackers based on Ethics:
1. Black Hat Hackers: is a computer hacker who violates laws or ethical standards for nefarious purposes, such as cybercrime, cyberwarfare, or malice.
2. White Hat Hackers: is an ethical hacker.
3. Grey Hat Hacker: is a computer hacker or computer security expert who may sometimes violate laws or typical ethical standards, but usually does not have the malicious intent typical of a black hat hacker.
## Types of Hackers Based on Skills
1. Newbie/ Noob: Don't have any knowledge about hacking.
2. Script Kidde: Is an individual who uses scripts or programs developed by others.
3. Hacker: Perfectly Skilled but with less experience.
4. Elite/Pro Hacker: Perfectly Skilled and with Much more experience.
## Why Do We learn Hacking??
1. To prevent hackers from gaining access
2. To uncover vulnerabilities
3. To strengthen the organization
4. To safeguard the data
5. To avid security breaches etc.....
## Why do hack happens?
- It depends on the hacker's Motive.
- IN SHORT: ATTACKS= MOTIVE + METHOD + VULNERABILTY.
## Elements of Information Security
######  CIA TRIAD: 
- C refers to Confidentiality
- I refers to Integrity
- A refers to Availability
## Phases of Hacking
1. Reconnaissance
2. Scanning Gaining access
3. Maintaining access
4. Clearing tracks or logs
## Penetration Testing
- is a method of evaluating the security of an information system or network by simulating an attack to 1. Find Vulnerability 2. Security measures 3. Documentation and Report preparation.
## Why we need Penetration Testing?
- Identification of threats
- Security Protection and controls 
- Assessment of organization's Security
- Evaluation of Network Security
- Upgradation of Infrastructure
## Types of Pentesting
#####     Black Box Pentesting
- Testing system without prior knowledge.
- You test as an attacker.
#####     White Box Pentesting
- Testing systems with prior knowledge.
- You test as an developer.
####     Grey Box Penetesting
- Testing systems with limited knowledge.
- You test as an user.
## Cyber security Field Terms
1. Red Team: These peoples are offensive, and trying to attack, then report the way they got in.
2. Vulnerability: Assessment: These are peoples who do some security check based on some list.
3. Security Audit: a comprehensive evaluation of an organization's security controls, policies, and procedures.
4. Blue team: They are the defensive peoples who will do firewalls and try to protect you.

## Jobs with Ethical Hacking 
- Cyber security 
- Security analyst
- Cyber security consultant
- Web penetration tester
- Internal and external penetration tester
- Network Security Tester
- Bug Hunter
## Ethics of cyber Security
1. Respect the privacy of others
2. Think before you type
3. With great power comes great responsibility
- Ethics is the Most Important concept in cyber security, also this is a course focusing on Ethical hacking, aka “the Good guys”.
- We have to be ethical on every approach we are working. A single bypass can make your life in risk.
- So, always have “PERMISSION!”.
- Ethiopia have a Cyber Crime Law called “የኮምፒዩተር ወንጀል አዋጅ”. It have 6 parts. It is detailed on some attacks.
- Lets see some Ethiopian Cyber Laws.
- We as a Ethical Hackers, Our Goal and the Goal of this course is “To Create a Safe and Theaters Environment To humans”.
- But the only way to Protect Your device is by thinking like a BlackHat, so any examples I mention in this course can look like blackhat concept but try to understand that those examples are just for “ Educational Purpose”
